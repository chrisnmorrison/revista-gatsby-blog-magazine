## Lists

#### Unordered

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Very easy!

#### Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

###### Start numbering with offset:

158. foo
159. bar

```

At the moment, we have not implemented syntax highlighting. We recommend either prismjs or highlightjs if you'd like to add highlighting!

## Tables

Currently, we do not use HTML tables, however we may implement styling for this if there is a use-case in the future.
